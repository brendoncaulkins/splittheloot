# Split the Loot

Check out the app here --> [Split the Loot](https://brendoncaulkins.github.io/splittheloot/)

## Purpose

We love getting loot after our adventures, but those pesky minions rarely keep nicely divisble amounts of coina round, and doing math after a hard day dungeon delving is just cruel. So, this app intends to make it simple to split the loot haul among your party!
